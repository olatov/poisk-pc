Run the binary appropriate for your operating system (Linux / Windows / macOS) and specify the BIOS firmware to use
with the --bios-rom option (demo.rom is included in this release).

Example:

$ ./poisk-linux-x86_64 --bios-rom=rom/demo.rom

If a window appears titled “POISK Demo ROM” and displays color bars, the emulator is working correctly.

To run a usable system, you will need a full BIOS ROM (not included), for example:

$ ./poisk-linux-x86_64 --bios-rom=rom/bios-1991.rom


macOS Security Note
===================

On macOS, you may encounter an error preventing the binary from running because it's from an 
unidentified developer. To fix this, remove the quarantine attribute:

$ xattr -c poisk-macos-universal

After running this command, the binary should execute normally.

Tip
===
If you hear a click from the speaker every time you press a key on the keyboard,
it is a feature of the POISK BIOS. Press F4 to toggle on/off.


FAQ
===
Q: It says on the screen that I need to press "BK", what is this?
A: BK means CR (Carriage Return), essentially it's the "Enter" key on your keyboard.

Q: How do I switch the keyboard layout to Cyrillic and back?
A: Right Ctrl key (assuming BIOS v1991). The screen background color changes to blue when Cyrillic is active.

Q: I tried loading from tape, it said the file was found, but never loaded. Why?
A: After you press the F1 (Load from tape), you must enter the file name _exactly_ as on tape. E.g. 'BASIC' (uppercase!) for BASIC.

Q: I tried to boot into a disk OS but the machine froze in the process. Why?
A: The default of 128KB RAM is insufficient for many operating systems (MS-DOS 5+, FreeDOS, ELKS).
   Add `--ramsize=640` to the command line.

Q: I've booted into DOS and found that the hard disk is assigned the E: letter. Why not C: as I'd expect?
A: This is a quirk of the POISK BIOS which defines four floppy drives (A-D). Therefore, the hard disk gets the first available letter (E) after those.
   In practice, this affects DOS 3.30 and earlier. In DOS 5.0 or later, or FreeDOS, you will get to see the C: drive.

Q: Can I install Windows onto this?
A: Windows 3.0 or earlier will possibly work, although the experience isn't going to be great, given there is no mouse emulation at this point.


Known issues
============
* PC speaker emulation is far from perfect. The sound is there but can be somewhat choppy and distorted.
* Mouse is not (yet) supported.
